You just made your 2015 New Year's resolution to improve your data analysis skills and become data literate!

Every two weeks, we will e-mail you a dataset and some problems to work on. You can use any tool you'd like, although we suggest using R or Python. R is easy to install and if you are new to programming, the Introduction to R lesson is free in our courses!

Here's the first dataset and problem! Answers will be released at a later date. Tweet your solution @LeadaHQ!

====================

Dataset Description: A CSV of bicycle rental transactions for a rental company in California.

Problem 1: What was the average total time (in minutes) used by a bicycle in the data?

Problem 2: What was the most popular day by trip frequency in this dataset?

Problem 3 (harder): Assuming there are 30 bikes per station, find what date and time the bikes FIRST need to be rebalanced. As in, there are 0 bikes at a terminal for a customer to rent. 

Problem 3 (easier): Assuming there are 30 bikes per station, find what date the bikes FIRST need to be rebalanced. As in, there are 0 bikes at a terminal for a customer to rent. Do this ignoring "Start.Date" and "End.Date" columns.
